    At school I liked different subjects, here is a list of them.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Computer science">Computer science</li>
      <li><a href="#Physics">Phyics</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4 align="center" id="Computer science">Computer science</h4><br>
    I started to learn programming since I was at school,<br>
    I hated Computer science cause it was too boring for me.<br>
    Because of this I started to search for something interesting on the internet and found out that it is possible to create your own games to play.<br>
    Then I started to learn how does game developing works and started to learn Python.<br>
    Via using tkinter and the knowledje of physics I had I created my own game type: platformer.<br>
    That is the beggining of my IT carrier.
    <h4 align="center" id="Physics">Physics</h4><br>
    When I got to the 8th grade I passed exams to a local school for clever children.<br>
    There I met very fun and clever teacher of physics who could tell everythong very easily and understandable. Due to that I started to understand physics.<br>
    And physics became my favorite subject.<br>
