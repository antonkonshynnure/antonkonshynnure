      Smart machines have learned to bluff, outplay professionals in chess or
      Go, translate and recognize the human voice. Every week we learn about
      more and more exploits of computer programs that already know how to make
      medical diagnoses, draw as well as Rembrandt, sing or generate text.
      Should a person be afraid of artificial intelligence? Artificial
      intelligence (AI) has become a really hot topic in the last few years.
      Scientists associate this with the rapid development of neural networks
      (one of the areas of research in the field of artificial intelligence),
      which, in turn, became possible with the advent of powerful computers.
      "Since the early 2010s, influenced by the impressive success achieved by
      the use of multilayer neural networks (primarily convolutional and
      recurrent), this area has attracted serious attention from both scientists
      and engineers and from investors," comments the author one of the Russian
      chess programs, machine learning specialist Sergey Markov. The scientific
      community can argue about the timing of the emergence of smart machines,
      but they agree on one thing: the development of technology will have an
      unconditional impact on society, economy and relations between people in
      the future. Already, there are calls to consider ethical principles for
      developing artificial intelligence, making sure that artificial
      intelligence is developing in a direction that is safe for humans.
