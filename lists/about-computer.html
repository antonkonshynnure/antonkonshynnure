    <p>
      I got my computer when I was 18 years old. It was given to me for my
      attempting to university. It was a very welcome gift, as my peers already had a computer.
      I never thought about the question of what my computer means to me. He has
      become so significant to me that I am afraid to think about the moment
      when he will be gone. I try to sit behind him as much as possible. But,
      unfortunately, this is bad, it turns out that do not touch, you need a
      computer. It is elementary to write an essay or synopsis, you need a
      computer, to look at any information you also need a computer. Even to
      watch anime, I search the Internet and watch it on the computer, as it
      is very convenient. I like to sit on social networks, where I communicate
      with people who are 1000 km away from me. I also love to play various
      games. Nowadays, all documents should not only be on paper but also in
      electronic form. On the one hand, this is very good, because there are
      many programs on the computer that emphasize if there are errors,
      calculate correctly, and many others. Previously, before the advent of the
      computer, it was necessary to have many different devices to play, listen
      to music, watch anime, communicate with people who are very far away now,
      all you need to do is have a computer. It is very convenient and
      comfortable for people, no need to strain too much. The computer helps
      people very much, thanks to it, you can save time. But if you look from
      the other side, on the contrary, it takes a lot of time. For example, when
      we turn on the Internet we are drawn in, we do not notice how quickly time
      flies. We think five minutes have passed, but in fact, at least three
      hours. And because of this, you may not have time for anything. In order
      for the computer to bring only benefit and not harm, you need to use it
      rationally and as needed. In this case, the computer can help you save
      time and do a lot for you. And if you browse the Internet on social
      networks, look at pictures and videos, then it will not bring any benefit.
      But on the other hand, it is interesting, exciting, and thanks to this,
      you can see a lot of interesting things. If I was completely restricted
      from the computer, I would feel comfortable. At the moment, I cannot
      imagine my life without a computer. Since every year computers are more
      and more modified, they are even more addictive.
